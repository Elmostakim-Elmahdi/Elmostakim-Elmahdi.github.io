        <strong>Search bar searches as you type. There might be a delay depending on the results included!</strong>
            <BR><br>
            To search exact match use `+`
            <br>
            For example: `+mini +sonoff ` will show only devices with "Mini" and "Sonoff" in their name.
            <br><br>
            You can exclude any term from search results with `-`. 
            <br>
            For example: `mini -sonoff ` will show all devices named "Mini" that don't have "Sonoff" in their name.
